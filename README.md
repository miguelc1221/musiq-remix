# Musiq Remix

Musiq Remix is a music streaming app built with the goal of learning the Remix framework. It utilizes Apple's MusicKit JS, a JavaScript library that enables developers to access Apple Music's catalog and user's personal music library. This allows users to listen to their favorite songs and discover new music just like they would on the official Apple Music app.
